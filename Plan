1. Main
If run with no options uses details in main.py.
If have different username/password for each device type you must set the usernames in the script, cant do with run time argument (-u)
If run with -u flag it will use the same username/password fro both CKP and ASAs
If either asa_dict or ckp_dict is empty it wont prompt for password for that device type

2. Login
Uses try/ except so only fails it has tried all devices and one or more of them failed

ASA Errors:
Authentication failure - Means the username or password is wrong
Connection to device timed-out - means no SSH connectivty to the device

CKP Errors:
'Unable to connect to server. Please make sure that the server is up and running. - Means username wrong
'Authentication to server failed' - Means passwor wrong
403 Forbidden -  either not enabled or trying agasint HA standby device (don't have permission to access /web_api/login)

TODO
1. CKP -Test negate source and negate service -
Probably got to build checkponts at home to properly check with a few devices and all rul permitions

Test at work

3. Write unit tests

4. Template and format for adding other devices to this
What needs adding where in the script

5. See what happens if disable failfast if one device connection fails
